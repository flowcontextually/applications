# Contextually Applications

Welcome to the official public registry for **Contextually Applications**! This repository is the central "App Store" for the `cx` ecosystem, providing discoverable, installable, and community-vetted solutions.

An Application is a self-contained, versioned package that solves a specific business problem. It bundles all the necessary flows, queries, and scripts into a "toolkit-in-a-box" that you can install with a single command.

[**Learn more about the Application Ecosystem in our official documentation.**](https://flowcontextually.github.io/docs/concepts/application-ecosystem/)

## üöÄ How to Use Applications

You don't need to clone this repository to use these applications! The `cx` shell (`v0.3.0` and later) handles everything for you.

1.  **Search for an Application:**
    ```bash
    cx app search github
    ```

2.  **Install an Application:**
    ```bash
    cx app install official/github-repo-manager
    ```
    The `cx` shell will download the application, resolve its blueprint dependencies, and guide you through an interactive setup for any required connections.
